## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a restaurant owner who needs a system to keep track of their business.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- Users can add a new order, including details such as order name, customer contact info, and order type (walk-in vs by phone). They can also search and filter orders
- Non-admin users can edit existing orders and add items to them from the menu, while admins can create new menu items.
- Once menu items are added the user can log payment, select a payment method and add a tip amount. Adding these details will mark the order as closed.
- Once an order is closed, it will be added to the revenue tab where the user can see revenue data over a certain time period.
- On the home page, the user can use the artist booking system to book an artist at a venue in their local area.
